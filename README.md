Author - Yukta Rathore
This project is written by using python 3.10.4.
<br>
It uses the standard tkinter module for GUI(graphical user interface) from python.
Here python has been interfaced with MySqL.

The main aim of the project is to create an GUI application which is used to store the data and accounts of the people registering in the application.

The application provides options for the registration and then login.
After registering it provides options to deposit and withdraw money as well as lets us check our balance by retrieving information from database.
It also allows us to change password.
